# Basic Idea

Minimum top down Automatic Differentiation 

# Feature

Less than 30 lines of code for Automatic differentiation

(indicating about the code on Ad.hs)

# Execution

install Glasgow haskell (GHC) on your computer.

go to interpreter typing 

`ghci`

&

`main`

which will show you pairs of original expression & derivatives of 'x'

Note the last example which has multiple variables does not work out properly.

( Intentionally added for current scope. )


# Explanation

For logic on Ad.hs

Check the slides out on /doc/ad_slides.pdf

For other code, please refer comments in between lines.
